I am currently running Arch Linux (Endevour OS) on my machine with NVIDIA graphics.

Currently I have installed lutris and wine in the machine. I have used FlatPak to install lutris and also install wine tricks.

## Installation Process

Here is how you can install games in Lutris. 

1. Click on the add button and click on "Install a Windows game from an executable"

This will run you through windows installer and the game will be installed in your machine.

## Common Errors

Here are some common error that you will encounter and how to fix it.

1. ``archive data corrupted decompression fails`` or ``An error occured while unpacking: Not enough memory!`` this error can be tackled by switching the runner to "System".

2. ``Initial process has exited (return code: 0)`` this error comes if the path of the game set properly

    Mostly this will be the location for the Executable
