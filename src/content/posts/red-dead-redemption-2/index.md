Red Dead Redemption was one of the first AAA games that I completed. Even after playing many other games, it remains one of my favorites. The game showcases some of the greatest character development of all time. Here are some of the things that I like about the game:

- **Mechanics:** The controls of the game are top-notch. No one other than Rockstar can do a better job with the horse riding mechanics and other controls like hunting, etc.
- **Level Design:** Every chapter has a new theme and takes place in different locations, which makes the game even more interesting.
- **The Story:** RDR2 will go down as one of the games with the best story. You see how the protagonist changes with each level and becomes a totally different person by the end. The climax is one of the best endings I have ever experienced in a video game.
- **The Cut Scenes:** The cut scenes for each mission are crafted with high quality. The train heist scene is my favorite, and it was done exceptionally well.

Overall, this game is very fun to play. I played it on my friend's laptop, so I rushed through the game and completed it in around four days. However, I would prefer to play this game in a more relaxed manner, taking my own time to explore and have fun.
