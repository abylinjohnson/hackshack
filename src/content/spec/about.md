# 👋 Hey there, I'm Abylin!

Full-stack developer through the week, musician on weekends, and a movie buff somewhere in between! 🎵 🎬

## 🤓 The Tech Side of Things

I'm that person who gets excited about clean code the same way most people get excited about pizza! Currently crafting digital magic at BlockSurvey in Bangalore, where I juggle between Angular, React, Node.js, and occasionally wrestle with AI (spoiler: the AI usually wins 😅).

My coding journey started at Karunya Institute, where I probably spent more time debugging than sleeping (worth it though!). These days, I'm living the full-stack life, turning coffee ☕ into code using everything from Angular to fastapi, and sometimes poking around systems to find security holes (legally, of course! 🔐).

## 🎸 The Musical Me

When I'm not pushing commits, you'll find me behind my drum kit, channeling my inner John Bonham, or tickling the ivory on my keyboard. There's something magical about creating rhythms that make people move – it's like writing code, but for the soul! 🥁 🎹

## 🎬 Movie Maniac

I'm also a certified (self-proclaimed) film enthusiast! Whether it's intense dramas or mind-bending sci-fi, I'm always up for a good movie. Fun fact: I probably quote movies more often than I write console.log() statements – and that's saying something! 

## 💡 What Makes Me Tick

- Building stuff that makes life easier (like that QR attendance system I made - because who likes paper sheets?)
- Jamming with my instruments when code refuses to compile
- Finding security vulnerabilities (ethically!) because breaking things to make them stronger is totally my jam
- Turning caffeine into code solutions (and occasionally into drum solos)

## 🚀 Current Status

Right now, you'll find me:
- Crafting cool stuff at BlockSurvey
- Probably debugging something
- Planning my next side project
- Learning a new tech stack or a new drum groove
- Looking for the next great movie to watch

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

Whether you want to talk about code, jam together, debate about movies, or just grab a coffee, hit me up! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/abylinjohnson/) or check out my digital playground on [GitHub](https://github.com/abylinjohnson).

Remember: Life is too short for bad code and boring weekends! 🎉
